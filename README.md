# Account-managment-system

This project is a Python-based simulation of a basic banking system that allows users to manage different types of accounts and perform essential financial operations like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. It provides a foundation for handling common banking activities while ensuring transactions are processed securely, with checks for sufficient funds and appropriate handling of errors. The project is designed to be both functional and extendable, offering a simple yet effective way to simulate banking behavior.
Key Components:

    BankAccount: Manages core operations, including balance checks and transactions.
    InterestRewardAcc: Inherits from BankAccount and adds a 5% deposit bonus.
    SavingAccount: Extends InterestRewardAcc, adding a withdrawal fee and overriding the withdrawal method to account for it.
